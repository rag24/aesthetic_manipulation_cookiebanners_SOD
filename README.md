# Using Salient Object Detection to Identify Manipulative Cookie Banners that Circumvent GDPR
This repository includes the code used to collect the data, the collected dataset with button-level salience scores, and the code used to generate the salience scores.  This code and dataset corresponds with the "Using Salient Object Detection to Identify Manipulative Cookie Banners that Circumvent GDPR" paper published in ICWSM2026. 

The paper applies a unsupervised and generalizable slaient object detection model (SOD), called DeepRare [1], to the problem of aesthetic manipulation detection in cookie banners.
